This is a housing rental web application in which tenants can search for the latest
properties listed based on the location, price range, number of bedrooms, etc. and
landlords can add new properties.  Java servlets and MySQL were used for the back-end and HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript were employed for
the front-end.
